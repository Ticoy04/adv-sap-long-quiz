6. Web services is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems

7. The benefits of using we services is:

Exposing the existing function on the network, A web server is a managed code piece that may be accessed remotely using HTTP.

Interoperability, Different applications can communicate with one another and exchange information and services thanks to web services.

Standardized Protocol, Web services communicate via a specified industry-standard protocol.

Low Cost Communication, Because web services leverage the SOAP over HTTP protocol, you may implement them using the already affordable internet.

8. Characteristics of Web services:

XML-Based, web services use XML at data representation and data transportation layers.

Loosely Coupled, A consumer of a web services is not tied to that web service directly.

Coarse-Grained, Java and other object-oriented technologies use distinct approaches to make their services available.

Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous, The term "synchronicity" describes how the client is bound to the way the services are performed.

Supports Remote Procedure Calls, Web services use an XML-based protocol to enable clients to call functions, methods, and procedures on remote objects.

Supports Document Exchange, One of XML's main benefits is its universal representation of complicated texts in addition to data.

9. The web services architecture has a three distinct roles:

Provider, develops the web services and makes them accessible to client applications.

Requestor, is nothing more than the client application requiring communication with a web service.

Broker, is nothing more than the program that grants access to the UDDI.

10. *An application communication mechanism called SOAP is based on XML. It is equally platform and language neutral, albeit being noticeably slower and requiring more resources.

*You can construct SOAP-BASED web services with the use of the JAX-WS API, which is provided by Java EE in the Java environment.

*It can define a SOAP service in both an RPC and Document format using JAX-WS. The XML files are generated using a set of annotations that you apply to your classes in both styles.
